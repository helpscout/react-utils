# perf(options)(WrappedComponent)

Higher-order component that logs the mount/unmount/render cycles of a React component. Useful for debugging performance!

Inspired by React's performance tools and [`react-performance`](https://github.com/amsul/react-performance).

This is an alias for [renderSpy](./renderspy.md).
